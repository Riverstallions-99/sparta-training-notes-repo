## Estimation and Prioritisation

User stories are placed in priority order (the Product Owner's responsibility) depending on Business Value, Estimated Effort and Dependencies

### Estimation
#### Planning Poker
All team members choose a value for time taken (not always literal time but could be relative time eg story points, "sizes") and shows everyone at the same time. Potentially could refine with further "rounds" of planning poker to decide how much time it will take to complete a user story.

#### MoSCoW
**M**ust Have, **S**hould Have, **Co**uld Have, **W**on't Have


MVP: Minimum Viable Product

### Definitions of Done and Ready
Definition of Done: Necessary actions for completion
Definition of Ready: Prerequisites to be able to begin a phase

## Scrum Ceremonies

Daily Scrum/Stand Up: Daily, short meeting with your team to discuss progress, blockers and issues
Sprint: Fixed length period of time where work is completed, scope does not change during a sprint and you work towards a project goal
Sprint Review: Review what has been accomplished during the sprint, has anything changed? Have there been any user stories not started/not completed? (if so, put on the project backlog, potentially split into done and not done tasks)
Sprint Retrospective/Retro: A review of the process followed in the sprint, a chance to talk about things that went wrong, things that went well, things that need to be changed for the next sprint.
