James - Director of Public Sector relations, also Account Manager for PA Consulting


Classic problem statement "We have a graduate program, produces good staff. Challenge is there is no internal training for upskilling new hires." 
Risk and Cost problem for PA, so Sparta take on that risk by hiring us. (Increase in NI contributions means it costs more to hire people. Workers now have day 1 rights.)

For PA; their training is not the best it could be and managing and governance needs improvement. 

This is a proof of concept for an external graduate training programme. 12 month conversion window, move over to perm PA staff in that time, rather than 2 years.

Protected past the 12-month point
