### Agile Manifesto and Scrum Guide
Project vs SDLC (Software Development LifeCycle)

Initiation -> Planning -> Monitoring and Controlling & Executing -> Close


Product Backlog - Tasks needed for the whole project to be completed
Sprint Backlog - Work moved from the Product Backlog to be completed this sprint
Increment

#### Three Pillars of Scrum
Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation

### Requirements

Identify the goals required to successfully complete the project
Used by: 
- Stakeholders
- Business 
- Developers
- Testers

#### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional requirements: what a system needs to do, features etc. 
Non-functional requirements: how a system should behave, operational speeds etc.

Gathering requirements through:
- Observation
- Workshops
- Interviews
- Document Analysis
- Brainstorming
- Surveys and Questionnaires
- Prototyping

### User Stories

Addresses individual needs 
Eg. "As a... I need/I want... so that..."

I - Independent (self contained)
N - Negotiable (flexible)
V - Valuable (deliver value to the end user)
E - Estimable (able to estimate effort)
S - Small (able to be done in one sprint)
T - Testable (able to be verified/measurable in success)

#### Three Cs
Card
Conversation
Confirmation

The card is where you are recording the user story
The conversation is you discussing the user story with your team
The confirmation is everyone agreeing on that user story


### Acceptance Criteria (AC)

How do we know when a user story is complete?
Does the solution match the user story? (include all the things that should happen for a given user story)

"Sad path" - What should happen when things go wrong as an additional acceptance criteria

#### Gherkin format for AC
Given ... (context)
	And
When ... (action)
	And
Then ... (result/s)
	And
